≈ß≈ç# Shell, I/O Redirections and Filters :computer: :file_folder:

## Project Overview :mag:

This project was completed during my **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. The primary learning objectives of this project were as follows:

- Understanding Shell and I/O Redirection
- Familiarity with commands like head, tail, find, wc, sort, uniq, grep, tr
- Redirecting standard output to a file
- Getting standard input from a file instead of the keyboard
- Sending output from one program to the input of another program
- Combining commands and filters with redirections
- Special characters and their usage
- Manipulating files and text
- Understanding the format of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow files

## Technologies Used :gear:

- Scripts written in Bash
- Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
