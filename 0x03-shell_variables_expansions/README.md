# Shell, Init Files, Variables, and Expansions :computer: :file_folder:

## Project Overview :mag:

This project was completed during my **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at **ALX School**. Its primary goal was to gain a deeper understanding of various shell concepts, including alias builtins, help builtins, local and global variables, as well as special parameters like `$?`. We also explored the usage of single and double quotes in the **Shell**.

## Technologies Used :gear:

- Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
- Tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS

## Project Files :page_facing_up:

All the following files are scripts:

| Filename             | Description                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `0-alias`            | Creates an alias                                |
| `1-hello_you`        | Prints `hello user`, where user is the current Linux user |
| `2-path`             | Adds `/action` to the `PATH`. `/action` should be the last directory the shell looks into when looking for a program |
| `3-paths`            | Counts the number of directories in the `PATH` |
| `4-global_variables` | Lists environment variables                     |
| `5-local_variables`  | Lists all local variables, environment variables,
