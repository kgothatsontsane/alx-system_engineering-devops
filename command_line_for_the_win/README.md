# üî• Command Line For The Win üî•

[CMDCHALLENGE](https://cmdchallenge.com/) is an awesome game that challenges your Command Line skills.

I have provided the screenshots of my progress in the [CMDCHALLENGE](https://cmdchallenge.com/) and the tasks 0-9, 10-18, 19-27 in .png format.

The steps I have taken to use the SFTP command-line tool so that I can perform the file transfer using SFTP are as follows:

## 1. üåê Connecting to the Sandbox Environment
Established a connection to the sandbox environment using the SFTP command-line tool with the following command:
```bash
sftp 8c60a240e4fb@8c60a240e4fb.9b220f8f.alx-cod.online
```
which uses the host name and username. I was asked for a password and used the one provided to me for the sandbox environment.

## 2. üöÄ Navigating to the Target Directory
Once connected, I navigate to the directory where I want to upload the screenshots, which is `/root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/` directory.
I use the command:
```bash
cd /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/
```
to navigate to the directory and also used the command:
```bash
pwd
```
to confirm that I am indeed in the correct directory.

## 3. üì§ Uploading Screenshots
Use the SFTP `put` command to upload the screenshots from my local machine to my sandbox environment.

Before I upload the screenshots to my sandbox environment, I have to locate them on my local machine first. I use the following command to navigate to the folder on my local machine that has the screenshots:

```bash
lcd /Users/kgothatsontsane/Desktop/command_line_for_the_win/
```
Then I confirm that I am in the correct directory using the command:
```bash
lpwd
```
I then proceed to upload the screenshots using the command:
```bash
put *.png
```
And I get the output:
```bash
Uploading 0-first_9_tasks.png to /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/0-first_9_tasks.png
0-first_9_tasks.png                                              100%  313KB 127.4KB/s   00:02    
Uploading 1-next_9_tasks.png to /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/1-next_9_tasks.png
1-next_9_tasks.png                                               100%  322KB 215.7KB/s   00:01    
Uploading 2-next_9_tasks.png to /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/2-next_9_tasks.png
2-next_9_tasks.png                                               100%  410KB 438.3KB/s   00:00    
```
## 4. ‚úîÔ∏è Confirming Transfer Success
I then confirm that the screenshots have been successfully transferred by checking the sandbox directory. I list the files of the directory in the SFTP command line tool using the command:

```bash
ls
```
I exit the SFTP command line tool using the command:
```bash
bye
```

## 5. üöÄ Pushing to GitHub
The files are present in the directory, and I will now push the screenshots to GitHub as mentioned in the initial requirements.
